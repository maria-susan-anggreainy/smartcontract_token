# smartcontract_token
Create Simple Token Contract In Solidity

I used the Remix Ethereum web browser-based IDE.

The basic idea of this is my contract is that I am creating a token and 
I give the owner of the smart contract 100 tokens to begin with and if you are not the owner
than you can buy tokens and each token costs is one ether so youâ€™re going to send one ether you 
get one token back and the token balance is created that in this mapping over here and if owner 
think that its to many token than owner can burn tokens. 

I have require what I have actually the same require statement message send is owner you are not 
allowed and then burn tokens it must also be the owner and there is a basic architecture of how 
I can solve this and centralize this in a way with that works with modifiers.
